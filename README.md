## Basic Pitch: ##

    A posting board where active Clark students can upload and search through course reviews

## Essential Functions: ##
    - Home page is a list of departments. You can click on any to see all reviews of courses in that department.
    - Search bar in the top to search for specific courses.
    - New review button which allows users to fill out a new review form and provide their clark email address.
        * Submission of the form sends an email confirmation to the email address provided, if it is in the @clarku.edu domain.
        * Email includes "confirm submission" link which will publish the review if clicked.
